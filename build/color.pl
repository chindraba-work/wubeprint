=head1 NAME

Factorio Railway Print Maker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ perl wube_print.pl
  $ wube_print.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reads a data file with specific information about a blueprint or
blueprint book and makes the blueprints, and books, to meet that
definition. Targeted at train stops and trains, but possible use
for other prints later.

Intended as an autmoated method for making many very similar prints
with minor variations between them. For complex prints, or low
numbers of prints, the in-game system is much faster and easier.

=head2 EXPORT

None.
