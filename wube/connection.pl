=head1 NAME

Factorio Print Maker: _ object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gIDs = [1,3,5];
    my $rIDs = [3,5];
    my $singleConnection = wubeConnection( [[{red => $rIDs}, {green => $gIDs}]] );
    my $doubleConnection = wubeConnection([
        [
            {green => $gIDs},
            {red => $rIDs}
        ],
        [
            {red => [1]}
        ]
    ]);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a B<Connection> object for blueprint strings.

Includes the internal creation of B<ConnectionPoint> and B<ConnectionData> objects.

For object specs see:

L<Connection object|https://wiki.factorio.com/Blueprint_string_format#Connection_object>

=head2 EXPORT

    wubeConnection()

=head1 ROUTINES:

=cut

sub _wubeConnectionData {

=head2 _wubeConnectionData()

Creates a ConnectionData object

=head3 Argument: entryID

        entryID: integer (1-based), index of the entity at the other end of the wire

=head3 Return: ConnectionData object

=cut

    return { entity_id => shift };
}

sub _wubeConnectionPoint {

=head2 _wubeConnectionPoint()

Creates a ConnectionPoint object

=head3 Argument: arrayRefConnectionPoints

        arrayRefConnectionPoints: [ color-name, arrrayRefEntityList ]
            color-name: string, 'red'|'green', which wire is being connected
            arrayRefEntityList: [entityID, entityID, ]
                entityID: integer (1-based), index of the entity at the other end of a wire

=head3 Return: ConnectionPoint object

=cut

    return { map {
        (%{$_})[0] =>
        [ map { _wubeConnectionData($_); } @{(%{$_})[1]} ] ;
    } (@_) };
}

sub wubeConnection {

=head2 wubeConnection()

Create a Connection object

=head3 Arguments: arrayRefConnectionData, arrayRefConnectionData

        arrayRefConnectionData: [arrayRefWireList] (one per "connection", normally one)
            arrayRefWireList: [hashRefWireData,] (one per wire color, max two)
                hashRefWireData: {wire-color, arrayRefEntities}
                    wire-color: string 'red'|'green'
                    arrayRefEntities: [entityID, entityID,]
                        entityID: integer, index (1-based) of the entity connected to
        _The second arrayRefConnectionData is only used for items with a second connection.
        Such as the output for decider/arithmetic combinators.

=head2 Return: Connection object

=cut

    my $connection_number = 0;
    return {
       map {;
            { ++$connection_number => _wubeConnectionPoint(@$_) };
        } @_ 
     };
